=============================================

HTMLiHunter is an automated tool to detect HTML Injection vulnerabilities 
in web applications. It supports scanning GET and POST parameters, DOM 
reflection detection with Selenium, and custom payload injection.

Features:
- Injects multiple payloads into URL parameters and form inputs
- Detects reflected HTML in server responses and DOM using Selenium
- Supports custom payload lists

Usage:
------
Run the scanner on a target URL:

    python exploit.py "https://example.com/search?query=test"

With custom payloads (one per line in payloads.txt):

    python exploit.py "https://example.com/search?query=test" --payloads payloads.txt

Output:
-------
- Prints scan progress and vulnerabilities found
